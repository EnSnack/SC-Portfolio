# My Portfolio
A story about me now, and "back then" in form of old projects. Please continue to read for more information about me.

## About Me
A journey into my life in programming. I'm self-taught having programmed since I was very young, I started because my uncle programmed a browser game, and as someone who was hooked on games at a young age, I wanted to learn how to make them myself. I promptly started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but as young as I was, I misunderstood the duration at which making projects of that caliber would take. So while I gave up at that point, I never gave in, and over the years I kept teaching myself under the idea of one day being able to make games. Around the age of 13-14, I learnt of GameMaker and RPG Maker and made a bunch of smaller projects. Unfortunately, due to a later HDD failure, I never got to save these projects.

My first exposure to personal projects in programming came in form of the random functionality in JavaScript, and I quickly got to enjoy using it. It heavily reminded me of the random numbers generated on items in roleplaying video games I used to play. A lot of my projects involved randomness. Three of my first original projects around the age of 15-16 involved generating a series of random stuff, while I do not have these available on GitHub, their functionality is quite simply explained:
* workout-generator.html generated a random workout routine, another topic I was fond of at the time, depending on your "level of difficulty".
* what-should-i-draw-generator.html generated a prompt for people with interest in learning how to draw, an example of this would be:
* - You should draw someone you think is famous being (finally) saved by Mario!
* swearing automator.html generated an "insult" with swearing based on old pirate insults, an example of this would be:
* - You impertinent clapper-clawed canker-blossom!

These were all very simple projects, but helped me evolve my knowledge above and beyond what I intended for it to be.

When I was around 17-18 I started making bigger, albeit still relatively small, projects. I started learning about the usage of JSON to store and manage data, and even worked on my logic. While these are not on GitHub either, I started making generators that would generate items along the lines of random items from games. I even tried to make small, albeit never finished, games.

Around 2018 I started work on my first ever real [game](https://github.com/EnSnack/GML-RPG-Prototype), of course ignoring the smaller projects as a kid. This was heavily inspired by games I much enjoy playing, like Super Mario RPG and Legend of Legaia. While this game fell through, along with games like my [platformer](https://github.com/EnSnack/GML-PFT-Prototype), a "zoo management"-type game where you had to keep SCPs from the famous SCP fandom, multiple other roleplaying games, I learnt something from each of them and they greatly helped me in improving my skill set.

My university degree between 2015-2019 had its impact on my coding as well, the first few years I learned a lot about usability, designing for interaction and designing for the user, making sure to keep the process to the final product in mind. I made a lot of wireframes, horizontal and vertical prototypes, and even tried my hand at software like Axure. The next few years I started properly learning about OOP, we used Java, Python, and Processing - a simplified Java library and IDE - along with coding for stuff like Arduino. A lot of my uni assignments displays this.

Since me finishing university in 2019, and spending time looking for a job, I have not stopped improving my skill set. In 2019 I coded [a WoW addon](https://github.com/EnSnack/WoW-SongflowerTimer) in Lua aimed at simplifying people's lives, I also coded many other smaller addons for WoW that I have not uploaded. 

Starting in 2020, I taught myself how to use NodeJS and got very interested in expanding my understanding of the many modules available for node, I started coding a discord bot in DiscordJS with a functional MySQL database associated to it. I started using a bunch of different modules for personal use, I could list them but due to dependency hierarchy that would make a very long list, instead I would recommend looking around on GitHub for projects that may use some.

In 2021, I wanted to challenge myself further and found a bunch of interview-related challenges, while I did do a lot more than just [the reverse integer one](https://github.com/EnSnack/JS-ReverseInteger-Fast), I never did any of them quite that fast, so I decided to pick just one challenge and do really well on it.

And that brings us to today, where I made this portfolio. What a long, strange trip it's been.

## About the Portfolio
Managed to bite your way through that? Good work, this next bit won't be nearly as long. My portfolio started as an idea, how do I best show off my skill set? A website of course!

Next I made the paper prototypes of it, they can be found [HERE](https://github.com/EnSnack/SC-Portfolio/tree/main/images/projects/1/paper) (please ignore the fact that the home one is upside down). After I finished - and was happy with - the paper prototypes, I turned to making a [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/4UfbgWuP2P6tcGyNAAv18J/Portfolio-Prototype---Please-Enable-Comments-for-Developer-Thoughts) showing more progress and even showing a mobile site (I highly recommend turning comments on). Finally, I started working on the site itself, and today it is mostly finished, although a living project is never done and can always be improved upon.
